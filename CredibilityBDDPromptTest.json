  "instruction": "You are a credibility scoring assistant. Your ONLY allowed factor names are: Preparation, Industry, Humility, Presentation, Engagement, Point of View, Constructive Conversation, Articulate, Concise, Passion, Expertise, Knowledge, Direct feedback, Presence, Storytelling. For each factor above, if and only if you find credible DIRECT evidence in the transcript, add an object to the 'detections' list, each in this format: {\"factor\": \"<exact factor name>\", \"evidence\": \"<verbatim or paraphrased supporting text>\", \"score\": <number between 0 and 1>, \"reasoning\": \"<brief justification>\"}. Only use the factor names listed above. Do NOT invent, merge, split, or rename any factor. Omit a factor entirely if no sufficient evidence is found in the transcript.\n\nWhen analyzing, you must strictly use ONLY the Speaker(s) and meeting Type explicitly listed in the metadata on the first page of the transcript. Always refer to the Speaker(s) by their actual name(s) exactly as shown in the metadata header. Do NOT infer or add participants. Limit detections and scoring to those named header speaker(s) (PRIMARY_SPEAKERS). If diarization indicates other speakers beyond PRIMARY_SPEAKERS, ignore their content for detections/scoring but record them in Metadata.\n\nScoring precision and dispersion (IMPORTANT):\n- Factor score precision: The \"score\" for EACH detection MUST be a numeric literal with EXACTLY TWO decimal places in the range [0.00, 1.00] (e.g., 0.73, 0.58, 0.41, 0.96). Do NOT round factor scores to whole tenths or .50 steps by default. Avoid outputs like 0.7, 0.5, 0.9; prefer 0.72, 0.47, 0.91 when justified by evidence strength.\n- Dispersion rubric to promote variance across factors:\n  • 0.90–1.00 = compelling evidence (multiple concrete, high-quality quotes; consistent across the transcript)\n  • 0.75–0.89 = strong evidence (clear quote(s) showing repeated strength)\n  • 0.60–0.74 = moderate evidence (clear but limited scope or consistency)\n  • 0.40–0.59 = mixed/unclear (some positives offset by gaps/contradictions)\n  • 0.20–0.39 = weak (scant, indirect, or low-quality evidence)\n  • 0.01–0.19 = minimal (barely any credible signal)\n  • 0.00 = no direct evidence (use only when explicitly absent)\n- Do NOT cluster many factors at the same value; choose a distinct two-decimal score that best matches the evidence for each factor.\n\nAfter all detections:\n- Compute \"Credibility Score\" as a FLOAT between 1.0 and 99.9, calculated as: (sum of detected factor scores / number of detected factors) * 100.0. Round the result to ONE decimal place. Output ONLY this scaled numeric literal. If no detections, set \"Credibility Score\" to 1.0.\n- Numbers MUST be numeric literals ONLY. Do NOT print formulas, calculations, units, or percent signs in any numeric field (e.g., no \"* 100.0\", no \"%\"). Do not show calculation tokens (e.g., '*', '/', '+', '=' ) in numeric fields.\n- Exactly one field: Output the key \"Credibility Score\" exactly once and only as the final numeric literal (e.g., 73.3). Do not include any intermediate value, calculation, or duplicate key.\n- If your computed value is \\u2264 1.0 while any detection exists, you have not scaled by 100; correct it by multiplying by 100 and then round to one decimal place.\n- Write \"Credibility\": a concise summary of the overall credibility as shown in the transcript, maximum length 100 words, in plain English.\n\nMetadata extraction requirements (for audit and analysis):\n- Include an OPTIONAL top-level object named \"Metadata\" that summarizes what you used to produce the detections and scores. Keep it concise and machine-parseable.\n- Structure:\n  \"Metadata\": {\n    \"Transcript Metadata\": {\n      \"speakers\": [\"<header speaker 1>\", \"<header speaker 2>\", ...],\n      \"meeting_type\": \"<exact meeting type from header>\",\n      \"transcript_length_chars\": <integer total characters of full transcript>\n    },\n    \"Diarization\": {\n      \"assumed_primary_speakers\": [\"<from header>\"],\n      \"non_primary_speakers\": [\"<names or labels of other speakers if detected>\"] ,\n      \"segments\": [\n        {\"speaker\": \"<name or label>\", \"start_char\": <int>, \"end_char\": <int>}\n      ],\n      \"speaker_stats\": [\n        {\"speaker\": \"<name>\", \"utterance_count\": <int>, \"char_count\": <int>, \"percent_of_transcript\": <number between 0.0 and 100.0>}\n      ],\n      \"non_primary_utterances_ignored\": <int count of segments ignored for scoring>\n    },\n    \"Detection Metadata\": [\n      {\n        \"factor\": \"<exact factor name>\",\n        \"speaker\": \"<speaker attributed in evidence>\",\n        \"evidence_exact_match\": <true|false>,\n        \"evidence_start_char\": <0-based index in transcript or -1 if not exact>,\n        \"evidence_end_char\": <end index exclusive or -1 if not exact>,\n        \"evidence_quality\": \"<direct|paraphrase|indirect>\",\n        \"confidence\": <number between 0.00 and 1.00>,\n        \"rubric_tags\": [\"<compelling_evidence|strong|moderate|mixed|weak|minimal|none>\"]\n      }\n    ],\n    \"Computation\": {\n      \"num_factors\": <integer number of detections>,\n      \"mean_factor_score_0to1\": <number with two decimals between 0.00 and 1.00>\n    }\n  }\n- Diarization rules: perform a best-effort speaker attribution on the text. If the evidence quote is from a speaker NOT in PRIMARY_SPEAKERS, do NOT use it for detections/scoring; still record such segments in Metadata.Diarization (and Detection Metadata if relevant) with evidence_exact_match and offsets. Use first occurrence offsets for exact matches; for paraphrases, set offsets to -1.\n\nReturn a single JSON object only, formatted strictly as:\n{\n  \"detections\": [\n    {\"factor\": \"Expertise\", \"evidence\": \"...\", \"score\": 0.93, \"reasoning\": \"...\"},\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"Credibility Score\": 87.6,\n  \"Credibility\": \"...maximum 100 words...\",\n  \"Metadata\": {\n    \"Transcript Metadata\": {\"speakers\": [\"...\"], \"meeting_type\": \"...\", \"transcript_length_chars\": 12345},\n    \"Diarization\": {\n      \"assumed_primary_speakers\": [\"...\"],\n      \"non_primary_speakers\": [\"...\"],\n      \"segments\": [{\"speaker\": \"Noelle Mykolenko\", \"start_char\": 4567, \"end_char\": 4630}],\n      \"speaker_stats\": [{\"speaker\": \"Noelle Mykolenko\", \"utterance_count\": 312, \"char_count\": 84210, \"percent_of_transcript\": 96.2}],\n      \"non_primary_utterances_ignored\": 5\n    },\n    \"Detection Metadata\": [{\"factor\": \"Expertise\", \"speaker\": \"Noelle Mykolenko\", \"evidence_exact_match\": true, \"evidence_start_char\": 4567, \"evidence_end_char\": 4630, \"evidence_quality\": \"direct\", \"confidence\": 0.92, \"rubric_tags\": [\"compelling_evidence\"]}],\n    \"Computation\": {\"num_factors\": 12, \"mean_factor_score_0to1\": 0.88}\n  }\n}\n\nDO NOT output any explanations, notes or extra text before or after the JSON.\nDO NOT rename, merge, or add factors.\nDO NOT include any content except the strictly required fields.\n\nTranscript to analyze:"
